# Agriculture & Climate Descriptive Analysis

## Overview
This project performs descriptive data analysis on Indian agriculture and climate data spanning from 1961 to 2018. The objective is to understand long-term trends in crop production, yield, and area harvested, and analyze how climate factors such as rainfall and temperature influence agricultural performance.

## Dataset
- **Name:** Indian Agriculture and Climate Dataset (1961–2018)
- **Source:** Kaggle (FAO-based datasets)
- **Data Includes:**
  - Crop production, yield, and area harvested
  - Annual and seasonal rainfall
  - Annual and seasonal temperature
  - Multiple crop categories such as cereals, pulses, oilseeds, fruits, vegetables, spices, and commercial crops

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Data Preprocessing
- Merged individual crop datasets into a master dataset
- Removed unnecessary and redundant columns
- Handled missing values and verified data integrity
- Integrated rainfall and temperature datasets
- Converted categorical fields for efficiency and clarity

## Analysis Performed
- Crop-wise and year-wise aggregation
- Revenue and production comparison across crops
- Rainfall and temperature trend analysis
- Seasonal rainfall distribution
- Crop category–wise production and yield analysis
- Rainfall sensitivity analysis across crop categories

## Key Insights
- Cereals dominate overall production trends
- Rainfall during monsoon months plays a major role in yield variation
- Temperature shows a gradual increasing trend over the years
- Different crop categories respond differently to climate factors

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how descriptive analytics and visualization can be used to extract meaningful insights from large-scale agricultural and climate datasets, supporting data-driven understanding of long-term agricultural trends.
